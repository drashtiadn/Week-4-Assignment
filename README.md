# Week-4-Assignment: Advanced Regression Models
Objective:

The goal of this assignment is to practice implementing various advanced regression models such 
as support vector regression, decision tree regression, random forest regression models on a 
dataset and evaluate their performance using appropriate metrics.

Dataset:

For this assignment, we will use the "housing" dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository 
(https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/housing). The dataset contains 
information on various attributes of housing, such as CRIM, ZN, INDUS, CHAS, NOX, RM, AGE, DIS, 
RAD, TAX, PTRATIO, B, LSTAT, MEDV. The goal is to predict the Median Value(MEDV) based on its 
attributes.
